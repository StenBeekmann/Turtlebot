# Group T mobile robotics

Welcome to the group T mobile robotics gitlab! This repository contains example code for mobile robotics courses at KU Leuven campus group T, more specifically for the autonomous vehicles and embedded control systems courses. As well as documentation about this code and the robot platforms. To get started, take a look at the [wiki](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/imp/?n=Main.Education), which contains additional information and documentation. 

Information per course:
